See the [open issues](https://github.com/GreenTreeTeam/ChillingMusic/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

**Issues**
- When running parcel build index.html: @parcel/namer-default: Target "main" declares an output file path of "index.js" which does not match the compiled bundle
 type "html".
- Socials links not working
- Status: Loading permanently, likely due to not building correctly
